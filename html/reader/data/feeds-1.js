Wasting time, I blew three bucks on a slice of pizza and a sundae, and looked around for a place to sit down and pig out. The place was packed, and it was the middle of the day.<br /><br />So I sat down next to this group of people, and realized that one reason it was busy was that apparently people use the Costco foodcourt as a lunch place.

Ok, so it's the local God Squad having their lunch meeting, no biggie.

Which is not a good thing.<br /><br />At the same time I love the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">concept</span> of having a phone that runs Linux, and I've had a number of them over the years (in addition to the G1, I had one of the early China-only Motorola Linux phones) etc. But my hatred of phones ends up resulting in me not really ever using them. The G1, for example, ended up being mostly used for playing Galaga and Solitaire on long flights, since I had almost no reason to carry it with me except when traveling.<br /><br />But I have to admit, the Nexus One is a winner. I wasn't enthusiastic about buying a phone on the internet sight unseen, but the day it was reported that it finally had the pinch-to-zoom thing enabled, I decided to take the plunge.

Since then, she's busily been filling the kids clothes with names, re-doing their Tae-Kwon-Do uniforms etc etc.<br /><br />And why do I care?  It turns out that all those embroidery machines can be extended with new patterns, and most of them - including the one Tove has - seem to use this special and pretty much undocumented \"PES\" format that was designed by Brother. So Tove has been buying embroidery patterns, but actually seeing them on the computer and transferring them to the sewing machine is a big pain.<br /><br />So the above beautiful png file is what I did today. It's the result of me doing a thumbnailer for those PES files (and yes, \"PES\" stands for \"PESky\", I'm convinced), so that Tove can see the designs in her file manager as she moves them around.<br /><br />I can read them (largely thanks to converting a <a href=\"http://bobosch.dyndns.org/embroidery/showFile.php?pes.php\">php script</a> written by Robert Heel - which in turn seems to be based on a GPL C# project from <a href=\"http://www.njcrawford.com/embroidery-reader/\">njcrawford.com</a> - into C code) and then drawing them and writing the result out as a png out with cairo. Sadly, it seems that the embroidery machine itself sometimes has a rather harder time. When uploading the designs to the machine, a number of them just say \"Data Error\", which is very annoying.<br /><br />I wonder what those embroidery machine firmware people were thinking. No diagnostics, no nothing. If a design is too large for the hoop of the machine, the machine accepts it (no \"Data Error\"), but doesn't actually show or use the design - it just silently ignores it.<br /><br />Whee. Undocumented formats, bad firmware, lack of sane error messages.  And did I mention crazy interfaces? The embroidery machine itself shows up as a USB storage device when you connect it, except it for some reason takes about half a minute to calm down enough to be mounted. And forget about the embroidery card reader/writer - that one needs some magic USB driver too.<br /><br />But hey, if somebody else is fighting with PES files, here's a pointer to '<a href=\"http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/pesconvert.git;a=summary\">pesconvert</a>', my git source tree for that silly thumbnailer that created the above png. You'll need pnglib-devel and cairo-devel to compile it, but it's small and simple.

But I want to give a shout-out to Comcast.<br /><br />Yeah, that Comcast. That same one that everybody loves to hate.<br /><br />I switched from DSL to cable a couple of days ago, mainly because I had been hoping for a long time for our phone company (Qwest, who I also have had nothing but good service from) to offer faster DSL speeds. And they never did. So I decided that I should look at the alternatives.<br /><br />I went for the \"professional install\" from Comcast, because I was pretty sure that our cable needed upgrading (it did).  And since I hate renting any electronics equipment in our house, so I was off to Fry's before-hand, and I got a Comcast-approved Linksys cable modem with built-in firewall ethernet and wireless router.<br /><br />Everything worked out fine, the installer was a few hours late, but he was friendly and knew what he was doing. He did say that he would have suggested going with a stand-alone modem and separate router box, but I've used Linksys routers before, so I wasn't too worried and liked the all-in-one box.  I was left with some temporary cable laid in our back yard, and it's probably going to be that way for a few weeks, but all in all, a good experience.<br /><br />Until later in the day, when the Linksys box rebooted.<br /><br />And then it did it again. And again. Roughly once an hour or so. It came up each time, but there was a very annoying 70-second pause in my internet connection each time. I had good statistics on exactly when it happened, and how long the internet was off-line, because I'd done some silly tools to keep track of that earlier when I had had DSL line trouble (due to just bad signal and constant retraining).<br /><br />In other words, it turns out that the cable installer was not just friendly and knew what he was doing, he really was right on the money. I don't know why, but that Linksys cable router is apparently total crap. And googling for it, I was clearly not the only one with the problem. It looks like you should avoid the WCG200v2 like the plague.<br /><br />I asked Comcast (email support, just to see how <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">that</span> works) whether they can upgrade the firmware of the thing, or can do anything about it, but they answered that they can't do anything about customer equipment. Hey, fair enough. Not their fault.<br /><br />So, like any self-respecting geek, I decided that I'll just buy more equipment, because let's face it, you can never have enough toys in your home. So off to Fry's I went again, and got myself a DOCSIS-3.0 motorola box and a separate Netgear router.<br /><br />Not only did I decide to avoid Linksys this time, but the Netgear one made a big deal about running open-source software, and I assume the \"L\" at the end of the name means that the open-source in question is Linux. Sure, Linksys had a Linux router too (with a penguin!) but let's face it, they screwed up, so I'm giving the competition a go this time.<br /><br />So I need to provision it (ie letting Comcast know about the new modem MAC address), so I call up Comcast. It being a Sunday afternoon, I was expecting <span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"></span></span>that I'll just have to wait for Monday to get it sorted out. But no, not only is there a friendly tech who is greeting me with neither silly muzak nor waiting, but she's happy to get my all provisioned and up and running with a new cable modem in minutes (ok, so it took more than a couple of minutes, but a lot of it was literally waiting for the new cable box to boot up a few times).<br /><br />And so far, the new box isn't rebooting constantly whenever there's more than a few internet connections going on. Which is just as well, since it clearly does take longer to boot than the old one. Knock wood.<br /><br />So what can I say? Friendly competence all around.  Good for Comcast. And a big black eye for Linksys.","read":"0"},{"id":"22","feed_id":"3","title":"Pathetic","date":"2009-07-04 15:17:29.856","body":"It's the 4<span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_0\">th</span> of July, the kids are out playing, Tove's at the mall, and I'm following my new toy as it crawls across the map of the US towards me, courtesy of UPS tracking and google maps.<br /><br />This fall, we'll go for two scuba trips: in addition to our yearly week in Hawaii, Tove is treating me to a week in Belize.

Before somebody sends me the merge request from hell.<br /><br />So why am I in a good mood?<br /><br />My real \"work\" is not really writing code any more, and hasn't been for a long time. No, I worry most about the whole \"flow of patches\", and the way development happens, rather than so much about any individual piece of code I maintain. And the last few release cycles have had a couple of really hard-to-merge issues - not because the code was necessarily bad, but because of how it was then presented to me as a fairly messy history.<br /><br />And so far, the 2.6.31 merge window is going swimmingly. The x86 tree, which has gone through a yo-yo of different development models with (different) problems, seems to have gotten to that \"good place\" where it seems to be working.<br /><br />Part of the problem is that 'git' is such a flexible tool that you can use it in various modes, and mix things up freely.

Part of it is simply that reading is my only real hobby (scuba? Sure - one week a year. Reading? 51 weeks a year).  So I literally spend my time either in front of my computer or reading - and I don't waste it on commuting.<br /><br />Another part obviously ends up being that I'm just a fast reader. Oh, I know people who read faster, but if it's some easily read sci-fi or fantasy, I'll read at a pace of 100-150 pages per hour, and you simply <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">cannot</span> distract me while I'm reading. Try to talk to me, and I won't hear a word.<br /><br />So most books I finish in a single sitting, and weekends I might read two books in a day. The more sciency books I read take longer, but that may explain why I probably average about three books per week, and sometimes do many more - especially during the later parts of the merge window when things aren't as hectic on the kernel front.<br /><br />Anyway, the haul over the last couple of weeks has been mostly random stuff (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Fire Upon the Deep</span> by Vernon Vinge, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Golden Torc</span> by Simon Green, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Turn Coat</span> by Jim Butcher, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The Laurentine Spy</span> by Emily Gee). Don't ask me what the common thread is, because there is none.  Some were randomly picked up from the book store in desperation over not having anything at all to read, others were things I'd read the authors before. I enjoyed them all, in different ways.<br /><br />On the non-fluff front, I read <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Phantoms int he Brain</span> by V.S. Ramachandran, based on a recommendation in the comments of the last reading post. I have to say, it is a better book than <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The Brain that Changes Itself</span> (the one that triggered the recommendation), but at the same time I was also a bit disappointed with it.<br /><br />Why? All the chapters on different disorders were absolutely fascinating, but then the last chapter just stood out as a big disappointment. It seems that any time that people start discussing \"qualia\" and guessing about what consciousness is, otherwise sane and coherent people end up being just confused and crazy (example: Roger Penrose). Ramachandran avoids the outright crazy, but chapter 12 ended up being a big disappointment to an otherwise engrossing book for me. But even that disappointing chapter had interesting content in it.<br /><br />So, highly recommended, despite the small nagging feeling that the last chapter really could have been so much better. Most of the book is about the fascinating ways the brain fails at what it's supposed to do, and what it teaches us about how people really function.<br /><br />The other non-fluff book was Bart Ehrman's <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\"Jesus Interrupted\"</span>, a kind of follow-up to the earlier <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Misquoting Jesus</span> that I read some time ago. Bible study is actually fairly interesting, although in many ways I always thought the Old Testament was way more interesting. Ehrman, of course, concentrates pretty much exclusively on just the New Testament, with just passing mention of OT issues as they relate to NT issues. The book was also the inspiration for the current kernel naming (\"Man-Eating Seals of Antiquity\"), since it fit perfectly with my pattern of nonsensical animal-related naming scheme.<br /><br />Recommended.

Or rather - not like me, since I've had <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_1\">lasik</span>, and since she's more nearsighted than I ever was. She's blind as a bat without glasses or contacts, in other words.<br /><br />Also like me, she's allergic to pollen. She gets itchy, watery eyes. So at the optometrist, when they ask about whether she's had problems with her eyes, the allergies come up. And what do you know, they have eye-drops for that.<br /><br /><span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_2\">Ok</span>, not surprising. But what I <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">do</span> find surprising is the kind of eye-drops they have. This is a doctor's office, you'd expect them to be professional. But their eye-drops are homeopathic, and the doctor talks them up as not having any harsh medication in them. Well, duh! They're saline solution.<br /><br />So I sit there quietly, and don't call him out for being a quack, because real doctors do actually prescribe placebos, and maybe he does know better. And there's also no question that plain saline solution isn't a fine thing to use when your eyes are itchy.<br /><br />So afterwards, I spend some time afterwards talking to Patricia about placebos and homeopathy and quackery, in my never-ending hope that my kids won't grow up to be morons. But it's been a few days, and quite frankly, it still disturbs me.

I'm not going to make my own saline solution to save money. I'll happily pay extra for \"sterile\". I'll pay extra for nice prepared droppers in tiny sizes, even if it means you pay actual money for just tiny amounts of water with some table salt in it (no iodine - get the \"kosher\" salt if you want to make your own, and use distilled water).  I'll happily pay for the convenience of having somebody else prepare saline solution of the proper strength and in a convenient package.<br /><br />And the funny thing is, I don't mind it when I see the same thing at the checkout counter in the organic grocery store I prefer to go to.
